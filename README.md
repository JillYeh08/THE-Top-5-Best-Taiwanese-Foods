 ##  Large Intestine Vermicelli

  Out of all the best Taiwanese dishes, Large Intestine Vermicelli takes the number one spot for me. Though it may taste or feel off if you eat a bowl that isn't good, a well-made one is always the most comforting. The more popular version is Oyster Vermicelli, but as a disliker of most seafoods, I'd say the Large Intestine version is much tastier.

 ##  Taiwanese Meatball

   The Taiwanese Meatball, or Bawan, is made up of meat and a few other flavorful ingredients bundled in a translucent, glutinous skin. But the real star of the show is the sauce, which is salty, a little sweet, and usually a bit spicy. I, for one, *love* eating anything chewy and glutinous, and biting through a Bawan gives you a mouth full of textures and flavors.
