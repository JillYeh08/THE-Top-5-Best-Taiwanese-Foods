  Out of all the most scrumpdiddly of Taiwanese dishes, Large Intestine Vermicelli takes the cake for being the best of the best. Though it may taste or feel wrong if you get a bad one, a good one is always the most comforting for me. The more popular version is Oyster Vermicelli, but as a disliker of most seafoods, I'd say the Large Intestine version is much tastier.
